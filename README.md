# End-of-Arm-Camera-Mount
Designed a camera mount to mount onto either side of the end-of-arm tool and monitor pick and place. 
The goal was to monitor the pick and place actions to collect unobstructed and clear images of instances of failed action and use the images for image based retry after failure.
The part was manufactured and after testing, it achieved a 100% first pass yield with a loss of only 2 seconds.


Some of the constraints for the part design included choosing mounting position to ensure unobstructed and clear image within the working distance of the camera and lens. The camera mount was designed to have a clear view of the working volume as well as not block the view of the vision system located at the top of the robotic cell.


Another constrain was designing the part to account for the lack of space available and potential collisions while running production cycle. A dry cycle was run to determine the safe working volume and the manufactured part was tested with the production recipe with zero collisions.
